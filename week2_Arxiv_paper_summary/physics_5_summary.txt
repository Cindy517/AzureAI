The study investigates the filamentation of femtosecond vector beams with spatially varying polarization profiles in air. The vector beams include azimuthal, radial, and spiral cylindrical vector beams, as well as low-order full Poincaré beams with star and lemon polarization topologies. The findings reveal that the Gaussian mode primarily contributes to the filamentation of the vector beams due to their more effective nonlinear focusing. Additionally, the polarization profiles of the vector beams remained largely unchanged during filamentation, while the low-order full Poincaré beams underwent significant non-uniform changes due to differences in accumulated nonlinear phase and Gouy phase among the constituent modes.

The text discusses the phenomenon of filamentation, which refers to the self-guided propagation of high-power laser pulses over long distances. Filamentation has been extensively studied and has various applications, such as in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, single-cycle pulse generation, and laser-guided lightning. The report mentions important features of filamentation, including intensity clamping, generation of underdense plasma channels, supercontinuum generation, and conical emission. Simplified scalar models are often used to describe filamentation, while the effect of polarization and its dynamics during nonlinear propagation are mostly unexplored. The generation of novel forms of structured light, including vector beams with space-varying polarization, is also mentioned.

The text discusses the concept of polarization profiles and their applications in various fields. It mentions cylindrical vector beams (CVBs) and full Poincaré beams (FPBs) as two interesting categories of vector beams. The polarization morphology of CVBs is described as having cylindrical symmetry around the beam axis, while FPBs span the entire surface of the Poincaré sphere. The text also mentions different applications of CVBs and FPBs, including optical manipulation, optical microscopy, and formation of polarization speckle. Additionally, it highlights the investigation of polarization shaping effects on optical collapse and the generation of configurable THz metasurfaces. The study of the polarization distribution during the filamentation of vector beams is emphasized as being of critical importance for various novel applications involving laser-plasma interactions and sculptured electronic photocurrent circuits.

This study investigates the filamentation of femtosecond vector beams, including azimuthal, radial, and spiral CVBs, as well as FPBs with "star" and "lemon" polarization topologies. The aim is to explore how these polarization patterns affect the nonlinear propagation of the beams. The findings reveal that contributions from orthogonal polarization components significantly influence the filamentation of vector beams, with CVBs being more susceptible compared to optical vortex beams, while FPBs exhibit greater resilience to filamentation compared to equivalent Gaussian beams. Additionally, the polarization profile of CVBs remains unchanged, while FPBs undergo notable non-uniform polarization changes during their nonlinear propagation.

The equation describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in an isotropic medium. It includes terms for diffraction, dispersion, absorption, plasma defocusing, multiphoton absorption, and instantaneous Kerr effect. The self-focusing effect can balance the diffraction only if the input beam power exceeds a critical power. The equation also accounts for the effect of plasma.

The content of the text is a mathematical equation that describes the rate of change of electron density in a plasma. The equation takes into account various parameters such as the cross-section for multiphoton ionization, the density of neutral atoms, the cross-section for inverse bremsstrahlung, the ionization potential of the medium, and the recombination rate. The equation also considers the effect of polarization on different features of filamentation. The text mentions the generation of different polarization profiles for different values of the parameters.

The user is discussing the propagation of a Gaussian beam in air, with specific parameters such as pulse width, beam width, and central wavelength. They mention the use of an alternate direction implicit scheme for solving the nonlinear propagation equation. They also compare the filamentation of different polarized beams and discuss the intensity profiles and polarization morphologies.

The text discusses the polarization profiles of arbitrary transverse planes using Stoke's parameters. It also introduces the polarization ellipticity and orientation. It mentions that filamentation can occur only if the input beam power exceeds the critical power. The critical power depends on the input beam profile, and it is shown that optical vortex beams are more resilient to self-focusing and collapse. The text also presents time-averaged cross-sectional nonlinear propagation profiles of LG beams and CVBS. It concludes by mentioning that the evolution of the intensity and polarization profiles of the beams may change due to the combined actions of different linear and nonlinear effects.

The text describes the propagation profiles of the laser-induced filamentation regime, illustrating the time-averaged cross-sectional propagation profiles of the laser beam and the three CVBS. It explains that the time-averaging is performed over the temporal extension of the pulse. The nonlinear propagation profiles presented correspond to the initial profiles illustrated in figure 1. The evolution of maximum intensity and maximum electron density during the filamentation of the laser beam and the three CVBS is also discussed. The text mentions that the intensity slightly exceeds 2x10^13 W/cm^2 in all cases. Additionally, it notes that the onset position of the filamentation, its length, and the transverse dimensions of the filamentary structures are different in some cases.

The text discusses the propagation distances and peak values of the maximum intensity for two different beams, the LCP LG0,1 beam and the CVBS beam. While the peak intensity values are comparable to some extent, their differences indicate distinct filamentation of the beams. The graphs also show that the filamentation length and starting position differ for different cases. Additionally, the maximum electron densities achieved for the CVBS and the LCP LG0,1 beam are higher for the CVBS beam. The differences in the filamentation of the beams can be interpreted in terms of the distinct action of the optical Kerr effect on the evolution of the intensity of the beams.

The text discusses the increase in plasma density and its effects on plasma defocusing and pulse absorption. It explains that as plasma density increases, there is a stronger nonlinear focusing effect and absorption of pulse energy by the plasma. The text also mentions that higher peak intensities due to stronger nonlinear focusing lead to more energy loss through inverse bremsstrahlung. Additionally, it discusses the formation of smaller filamentary structures and the differences in polarization profiles between different beams.

The text appears to be discussing the preservation of beams upon filamentation due to the absence of the polarization component in the case of the lcpg0,1 beam, and the balance between the two polarization components in the case of the cvbs. It also examines the filamentation of the lowest-order full poincaré beams (fpbs) with polarization topologies known as "star" and "lemon". The intensity and polarization profiles of the star and lemon fpbs at the initial propagation distance are compared. The intensity evolution during the propagation is found to be identical for the star and lemon beams, and the mean diameters of the formed filaments by the Gaussian beam and the fpbs are also compared.

The text describes the evolution of the maximum intensity and electron density during the nonlinear propagation of three beams. The beams have different sizes, with one being about 120 µm and the other 175 µm. The maximum intensity is clamped at approximately 3x10^13 W/cm^2 for all three beams. The filamentation of the Gaussian beam begins at z=20.85 cm with a length of 114.59 cm, while the filamentation of the pointcaré beams onsets at z=69.41 cm with a length of 56.63 cm, about 2 times shorter than that of the Gaussian beam. The maximum electron density during the filamentation of the Gaussian beam reaches 3.3x10^16 cm^-3, slightly lower than the value of 2.85x10^16 cm^-3 for both FPBs. The differences in the filamentation of the LP Gaussian beam and FPBs can be understood based on similar cross-sections of the intensity evolution of the beams during filamentation.

The text discusses the polarization topologies and intensity evolution of the orthogonal polarization modes of the fiber-based photonic bandgap structure (FPBS) during filamentation. It explains that the cross-kerr effect causes mode reshaping, resulting in weaker nonlinear focusing of the whole FPBS band and the initiation of filamentation from longer propagation distances with larger transverse dimensions of the filamentary structures. Additionally, it mentions that the peak intensity of the LCp Gaussian mode is higher than that of the RCP LG0,±1 modes, and the cross-kerr effect of the LCp Gaussian mode leads to a uniform nonlinear focusing of the LG modes, resulting in an increase in the nonlinear refractive index over the doughnut-shaped profile of the beam.

The text discusses the maximum value of approximately 8x10^12 W/cm^2 for the peak intensity of the LCP Gaussian mode, while the peak intensity of the RCP Gaussian mode exceeds 10^13 W/cm^2. It is inferred that the maximum value for the LCP Gaussian mode is about 25 times more effective for filamentation than the RCP Gaussian mode. The main contribution to the filamentation of the FPBS is from the RCP Gaussian mode. The power carried by the Gaussian mode of FPBS is twice lower than that of the LP Gaussian beam, resulting in a shorter filamentation length for the FPBS. The polarization profiles of the star and lemon FPBS during their filamentation are also investigated. The time-averaged transverse intensity and polarization profiles of the beams at several propagation distances are shown.

The text discusses the propagation of filamentary beams in a saturable Kerr medium and the nonlinear effects that occur during this propagation. It mentions that the average polarization rotation and the transverse extension of the beam increase with the propagation length inside the medium. It also explains that in the case of filamentation, the wavefront undergoes a dynamic change due to the additional effects of plasma defocusing and temporal evolution of the pulse. The text presents figures showing the intensity and polarization profiles at different propagation distances to illustrate these phenomena.

The text discusses the filamentation of vector beams, specifically circularly polarized vector beams (CVBs) and lemon and star polarized vector beams (FPBs). The study investigates the changes in polarization rotation or evolution of the polarization profile between the two cases and attributes it to the difference in the underlying nonlinear propagation phenomena for each case. The results show that the filamentation of all three CVBs is identical since they have equal amplitudes of the constituent components, and the phase difference between the components that determine the polarization profiles of the CVBs has no effect on their filamentation. The study also compares the filamentation of the CVBs with a circularly polarized LG beam, where only the self-kerr effect is present, and demonstrates that due to the simultaneous action of both the self- and cross-kerr effects during the nonlinear propagation of the CVBs, they are more prone to filamentation than the circularly polarized LG beam. The filamentation of star and lemon FPBs and their contribution to the filamentation of the whole beams are also investigated. The results indicate that the LCp Gaussian component dominates the filamentation of the whole beams.

The main contribution of the study is the comparison of filamentation of femtosecond pulses in different polarization states. The study demonstrates that linearly polarized Gaussian beams form filaments more easily compared to focal plane beam splitters (FPBS). The polarization profiles of the vector beams remain substantially unchanged during their filamentation, while the polarization morphologies of the FPBS experience remarkable non-uniform changes due to the difference between the accumulated nonlinear phases and the difference between the Gouy phases of the two modes. These findings have the potential to contribute to advancements in the field of ultrashort pulse filamentation and its applications, such as generation of high-harmonic generation, molecular alignment with ultrashort pulses, laser-induced material structuring, etc. Additionally, the study proposes that the polarization shaping of the initial femtosecond beam could enable precise control of the filamentation process.
