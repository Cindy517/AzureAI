The authors are from the Computer Science Department at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca in Romania and Emotion SRL in Italy. The rise of renewable energy coincides with the shift towards EVs, which poses technical and operational challenges for the energy balance of the local grid. Coordinating power flow from multiple EVs into the grid requires sophisticated algorithms and load-balancing strategies as the complexity increases with more EVs.

This paper proposes an EV fleet coordination model to ensure a reliable energy supply and maintain a stable local grid by utilizing EVs to store surplus energy and discharge it during periods of energy deficit. The optimization problem is addressed using Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) considering criteria related to energy grid balancing, time usage preference, and the location of EV drivers. The EV schedules, associated with the position of individuals from the population, are adjusted through exploration and exploitation operations, and their technical and operational feasibility is ensured. The solution is evaluated within the framework of an e-mobility service intercity. The results indicate that coordinated charging a

The content discusses the importance of balancing service requirements and user preferences when discharging electric vehicles (EVs). It also mentions the promising outcomes of assessing the quality and efficacy of determined solutions, with convergence after 100 iterations. The distribution of solutions exhibits strong hyper-volume, covering a significant portion of the objective space. Keywords include EV fleet coordination, Harris hawks optimization, EV charging and discharging, multi-criteria optimization, and grid balancing. Electric mobility is gaining traction due to global warming and climate change, with EVs becoming the third most popular powertrain choice after gasoline and hybrid cars.

Electric vehicles are primarily attributed to economic and regulatory factors. The price of lithium-ion batteries has decreased by 97% in the last 30 years due to research and development outcomes and increased usage of these batteries. Fossil fuels were the cheapest way to generate energy for a century, but the cost of solar energy has dropped by 89% in just a decade. Unlike fossil fuels or nuclear energy, renewable energy sources like wind and sunlight are free, so their operating costs are lower. Regulations have been developed to combat climate change, with the European Parliament mandating a 55% reduction in new vehicle emissions by 2030 and eventually a 100% reduction.

In 2035, the United States implemented the federal Clean Air Act, which allowed states like New York and California to adopt a zero-emission vehicle standard. New York, along with several other states, joined an initiative aiming to deploy 3.3 million electric vehicles by 2025. The scenario of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 serves as a normative pathway for the global energy sector. The increased share of renewables coincides with the shift towards electric vehicles, which brings technical and operational challenges but could provide a solution to manage peak demand and grid balancing. The charging and discharging of electric vehicles could be coordinated as a decentralized energy storage system used to guarantee the uninterrupted operation of a local energy system. As a result, energy and mobility services can be coupled to provide additional benefits.

The content discusses the benefits of implementing coordination in the charging operations for vehicle owners or energy communities. It mentions that this coordination can lead to additional revenue and a more reliable energy supply while avoiding investment in expensive devices. However, it also points out that coordinated charging operations may increase demand during peak hours and could overload distribution transformers and cables if the actual energy context of the local grid is not taken into consideration. Another significant benefit of implementing coordination lies in the realm of cost optimization. Utility companies often employ dynamic pricing models that factor in the time of day and overall demand on the grid, mirroring the principles of a free market where prices are determined based on the intersection of supply and demand. By strategically coordinating EV charging activities during periods of low-cost electricity, both owners and energy communities can take advantage of reduced electricity rates.

Overall cost savings in the charging process have led to a growing interest in developing strategies to coordinate the charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs) in a way that can help balance the supply and demand of electricity on the grid. The latest research focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence to manage EVs for various purposes, such as integrating renewable energy, demand response, or decentralized energy storage. For example, off-peak demand charging schedules the EVs for time slots when the grid load is minimal, or on renewable generation peak charging schedules the EVs for time slots when there is a high availability of renewable energy in the local grid. However, these techniques only partially address the issue and require interoperability with energy system operators to get the load and time of day information. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology addresses the issues by enabling bi-directional charging and discharging of EVs, allowing them to not only consume energy from the grid but also provide energy back to the grid.

The content discusses communication between electric vehicles (EVs) and the grid, enabling them to feed energy back into the grid when needed by discharging their batteries. This allows for smart coordination of a fleet of EVs to offer features like energy storage. However, coordinating the power flow from multiple EVs into the grid requires sophisticated grid management algorithms dealing with many variables and integrating load-balancing strategies. Smart control of the centralized EV charging stations can be addressed using reinforcement learning techniques that do not need explicit models. Limitations in optimization problem and decision search space sizes with the number of vehicles and considered variables pose a challenge, making heuristic algorithms a suitable option due to their ability to quickly and efficiently search.

The content discusses the use of a vast solution space to find optimal solutions. It proposes an EV coordination model to provide balancing services in the local grid by determining the optimal planning of EV charging and discharging. The model aims to ensure a reliable energy supply and maintain a stable local grid by storing energy surplus in EVs and discharging it in periods of energy deficit. The coordination of EVs is optimized using the Harris Hawks optimization algorithm, which mimics the hunting tactics of Harris Hawks working together in a group to catch their prey.

The content discusses the concept of catting and maintaining relative positions or adjusting the hunting strategy in real-time. It mentions mapping the hawks and rabbits to energy matrices indicating charging and discharging activities at specific stations during different periods. The algorithm's iterations adjust the schedules associated with the position of individuals from the population. The collaboration mechanism allows solutions to be shared among individuals, enhancing the algorithm's ability to find optimal or near-optimal solutions in parallel. The paper's contributions include a coordination model for a fleet of EVs to provide balancing services in the local grid considering operational and technical factors.

The content discusses an energy service and time of use constraints. It mentions a multi-objective algorithm for optimal scheduling of charging and discharging actions, using energy matrices and operators for efficient exploration and exploitation of the search spaces. It also discusses the evaluation of an electric mobility service from Italy, considering interoperability for gathering the operational constraints and technical characteristics of the CSS and fleet of electric vehicles. The optimization model can make informed decisions based on up-to-date information, resulting in a more accurate and effective charging and discharging schedule to balance service requirements. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the state-of-the-art EVS coordination models focused on those using nature-inspired heuristics, Section 3 describes the proposed EVS coordination model and the constraints considered, Section 4 shows how HHO was used for optimization, and so on.

The content discusses the use of EV coordination to provide balancing services and optimization solutions. Section 5 describes the evaluation results in the context of a mobility service from Italy. Section 6 discusses the impact of various parameters tuning on performance and convergence. Section 7 presents conclusions and future work. The related work uses artificial intelligence solutions for coordinating the charging and discharging of EVs to meet different objectives such as grid balancing, renewable energy integration, demand response, decentralized energy storage, etc. The EV coordination problem deals with many variables and constraints, therefore heuristics such as genetic and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are mainly used to address these issues. Genetic optimization is used for tasks such as EV route optimization, charging station placement, and energy management to optimize energy use and minimize costs.

The content describes an evolutionary approach based on the constraint non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to schedule the charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs) to maximize the benefits of all stakeholders involved, including EV owners, operators, and the grid operator. Three objective functions are considered: electricity cost minimization for owners, revenue maximization for operators, and energy balancing for grid operators. The NSGA-II algorithm is used to generate a set of pareto-optimal solutions, and fuzzy set theory is used to select the best solution from the pareto set. Several constraints are defined, including the power flow in the lines that must be as low as possible. The content also proposes a power management solution to reduce the operating cost of PV-based CSS by using EVs as a decentralized energy storage system.

The content is about a centralized energy storage system that is modeled as a multi-objective optimization considering variables such as remaining parking time, current and target state of charge (SoC) of the EV's battery, and maximum allowable battery charging and discharging cycles. Genetic algorithms are used to minimize the overall costs associated with EV charging and to ensure that the energy demand from the EVs does not exceed the capacity of the electrical grid. The scheduling algorithm takes as inputs a set of charging event matrices that are continuously updated during the charging process. The matrices store information about EVs, such as charging location, charging duration, and desired SoC.

The content discusses optimization, parking duration, charging power, and initial state of charge (SoC) in order to determine the available charging slots. It also proposes a two-layer genetic algorithm to schedule the charging of electric vehicles and generate personalized charging profiles based on the preferences of the driver and the operator. By decoupling the optimization criteria from the search space, it becomes possible to customize the criteria to meet the specific needs of each application. The content also mentions the use of NSGA-II multi-objective optimization to optimally schedule the charging to minimize the peak load and maximize the CSS benefits. Since the optimization criteria are contradictory, the purpose of the NSGA-II algorithm is to identify a compromise solution that is good enough from the perspective of both criteria.

I can help manage grid network stress and improve user satisfaction by scheduling EV charging while using efficiently microgrid's renewable energy generation. The algorithm determines the best combination of EVs based on energy demand, power ratings, kWh values, and SOC values. The chosen EVs are then scheduled such that the surplus energy within the microgrid is used to the maximum using the valley filling technique. Population-based heuristics are used for similar purposes as genetic solutions, but in their case, the optimal solution is found by iterating population individuals in the solution space based on their movements and the movements of their neighbors in search of a goal. An optimization model based on an enhanced PSO is introduced to optimize the charging and discharging behaviors of EVs in a power grid, considering several constraints: network constraints, on-load switch transformer constraints, transmission power constraints, charging

The content discusses the challenges of managing and optimizing power constraints, reducing power losses, tuning control equipment within the power network, achieving a smoother daily load curve, and ensuring satisfaction of electric vehicle owners. It also mentions the use of a feasible reservation strategy to handle quality constraints related to charging and discharging, as well as scheduling EV charging within a parking lot while minimizing overall charging cost. Various algorithms such as PSO and mixed frog jumping are applied to minimize the total cost of grid charging, considering demand dynamics and electric vehicle engagement in the scheduling.

The content discusses the optimization of energy scheduling for electric vehicle arrival and departure times, as well as prioritizing EVs that have booked a charging slot. The optimization algorithm aims to minimize energy costs, manage peak load demands, extend battery life, and fulfill user travel needs. It uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the problem of optimal energy scheduling, considering the associated costs with EVs and battery degradation. The algorithm helps reduce erosion and differentiate peak-valley differentiation in the system. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization is applied for energy scheduling of EVs within urban residences.

The content discusses the use of optimization algorithms to reduce the total power load and scheduling costs. The solution advantage lies in its adjustable parameters, fast convergence speed, and strong optimization capability while considering factors related to the operation mode of the PV system, charging requirements, transformer capacity limitation, SOC, and user behavior. Various solutions such as particle swarm optimization and arrival time-based priority and SOC-based priority are considered. The objective is to minimize the cost of charging while meeting constraints related to the state of the CS while comparing the performance of the proposed solutions. They are considering microgrids with renewable resources scenario to reduce energy consumption and charging costs by strategically redistributing EV load and enhancing customer benefits by reducing the electricity cost. Other heuristic algorithms applied for optimal energy scheduling.

The content discusses various algorithms and techniques for improving the efficiency of operating electric vehicles (EVs) in a microgrid. It mentions the use of improved marine predator algorithms, artificial bee colony algorithms, hybrid metaheuristics, and greedy heuristics. These algorithms consider uncertainties due to changes in battery performance and electricity pricing. The content also proposes the use of a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm to meet energy demands and maximize available power usage while managing a fleet of EVs. The algorithm performs well in benchmark tests.

The content discusses the problem of optimal allocation of EV parking lots and scheduling of electric vehicles in a smart distribution network. The authors propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that integrates genetic, PSO, and imperialist competitive algorithms to solve the optimization problem. The genetic algorithm is initially used to identify the optimal solution for grid losses and voltage drop, which is then improved by applying PSO and imperialist competitive algorithms. The proposed solution aids utilities and transportation agencies in improving EV operation and reducing charging's impact on the power grid. Additionally, the authors use a greedy heuristic to optimally schedule the EVs while considering the uncertainty in energy generation. The objectives are to minimize the overall energy cost and balance the microgrid electricity by considering electricity price, EVs' arrival and departure times, and total revenue.

The content discusses a proposed algorithm to schedule the charging of a fleet of EVs based on available energy on the grid and reservations made. The algorithm can iteratively destroy and restore the components of the best solution identified by introducing three destroy operators (random, relatedness, and no overlap operators) and a repair operator using mixed integer linear programming. The aim is to optimize EVs' charging and discharging schedules to balance the local power grid while maintaining safe operations and energy supply. The assumptions and constraints are noted, including the set of charging stations connected to the grid.

The content describes a charging station characterized by certain features presented as variables of a decision vector for each time slot. The variables include the charging or discharging power of the station and the station location in the local grid. The charging or discharging power of the station is an important feature since different models of electric cars have different charging power constraints. It is determined based on the nominal voltage and intensity of the current characteristics of the station. Consequently, when a need for charging/discharging arises, the station is chosen considering the maximum power.

The content discusses the factors that need to be considered for charging or discharging a power available for the slot and time needed. Other factors include weather conditions, planned time slots for the next day, EV battery lifespan, and the charging level of the battery. It also mentions that if the state of charge (SOC) of the battery is below 20% or above 80%, the charging speed is lower to increase battery life. The fleet of EVs is denoted by EV = {evi | i ∈ {1…n}}, where n is the number of EVs in the fleet and evi is formally defined based on its changing features at time slot t as: evi = [SoCi, Ei, c, Ei, d, ti, lifespanspani, ti, φi], where SoCi, c, and Ei, d is the amount of energy that can be charged or discharged for the battery, ti is the time needed to operate charging or discharging, φi is the location in the microgrid, and lifespanspani is the battery lifespan.

The content discusses battery lifespan and the maximum charging or discharging time. It states that the charging or discharging time (ti) is always lower or equal to the time slot used in scheduling (t). The state of charge (SoC) of the battery is expressed in percentages relative to the maximum capacity (Cmax) specified by manufacturers. A SoC value of 100% means the battery is fully charged, while a SoC value of 0% means the battery is completely discharged. As the battery's maximum capacity decreases over time, a 100% SoC on an older battery may only represent a fraction of the capacity compared to a new battery. The amount of energy that can be charged from the battery in the time slot (ti) is calculated using the voltage (Uj), current (Ij), and time (t). The energy to be charged in the battery is determined accordingly.

The content discusses a formula for estimating the energy discharge of a battery. The formula takes into account the target value and current value of the battery state of charge, as well as the maximum intensity of the current needed to reach the maximum capacity of the battery. Additionally, the content introduces a loss factor (σ) for the energy conversion process. The content also suggests that the remaining charge-discharge cycles of the battery (nᵢ,ᵣ) can influence its scheduling decision for charging and discharging. The formula for the remaining cycles takes into account the maximum number of cycles (nᵢ,ᵤₓ) and a time interval (τ).

The content describes the charge-discharge cycles of an electric vehicle's battery. The manufacturer specifies the correct exploitation and an integer value, 𝜏, is used to approximate the impact of partial charging and discharging operations on the battery's remaining useful life. The remaining charge-discharge cycles of the battery can be approximated as 𝑛𝑖,𝑟 = 𝑛𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑛𝑖,𝑐. The time to charge or discharge an EV's battery from the actual state of charge (SoC) to the target one is bounded by a minimum and maximum operational time. The minimum charge or discharge time, 𝑡𝑖,𝑚𝑖𝑛, reflects the time needed to reach the SoC target value under normal conditions, while the maximum time, 𝑡𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥, reflects the impact of special not optimal conditions.

The content provided consists of mathematical equations and definitions related to the charging power and efficiency of a station, as well as the estimated waiting time for an electric vehicle (EV) before charging or discharging at a station. It also considers constraints related to the scheduling of EVs at charging stations, such as time intervals, waiting time, distance to the station location, etc.

The content appears to be discussing the ordering of preferences based on their importance, using a relation defined on a set. It also mentions the completeness and transitivity axioms that the preference set satisfies. Additionally, it mentions energy scheduling optimization in the context of coordinating charging and discharging actions at stations to deliver balancing services in a renewable-powered local grid.

The content discusses generation resources, consumers, and energy storage devices that are used as second-life energy storage devices. It also mentions the balancing services that are defined for the next day by looking at the forecasted total energy demand and generation values for the microgrid over the optimization window T. The energy balance profile of the local grid considering the uncertainty associated with the estimates is determined using the difference between the two energy profiles over T. The energy balance is modeled using the value-at-risk method, which measures the maximum loss of a scheduling optimization due to inaccurate estimation of the energy balance. Historical values of energy balances can be used to determine the arithmetic return over the interval T.

This content appears to be a mathematical equation or formula. It discusses the calculation of the return on a given period and the determination of confidence levels. It also mentions the energy balance and the scheduling of events.

The content describes the process of charging and discharging energy at a set of stations, in order to compensate for the predicted surplus or deficit of distributed energy storage. The amount of distributed storage of energy is determined based on the charging and discharging actions on available electric vehicles. The operations of charging or discharging the battery for an EV are mutually exclusive for a time slot. In the scheduling problem, EVs should be scheduled to either charge or discharge to meet the objective function defined in equation (29).

The content provided is a mathematical representation of an event scheduling matrix. The matrix represents the time slots of the next day, with rows representing the available resources in the grid. The content also mentions that the charging and discharging operations are mutually exclusive in each cell of the matrix. It then discusses how the elements of the matrix can be summed to obtain the corresponding energy value for each time slot. Finally, it mentions that several constraints need to be enforced and that the energy storage amount must be accumulated for each time slot.

content appears to be a mathematical equation or formula that discusses constraints and conditions for scheduling and balancing energy. It mentions the energy balance, scheduling conflicts, discharge cycles of batteries, and location thresholds. It also refers to a multi-objective model for population modeling.

The content appears to be discussing an optimization process for the scheduling and coordination of EVs (electric vehicles) to provide balancing services for grid energy generation and demand. The content includes phases of exploration, transition, and exploitation, as well as relevant operators to address the specificity of EV scheduling and coordination. The position of the Harris Hawks is modeled using the scheduling matrix of EVs on the CSS. The objective is to find the best scheduling of EVs to balance grid energy generation and demand, and the fitness function is based on a specific relation. The prey is modeled as the agent with the best position in the optimization window, and the fitness function is applied over the entire day. The content also mentions the number of agents in the population.

The content describes an algorithm that searches for new solutions by improving the best one found so far. Each solution represents a hawk location, and the best one is seen as the prey. The search is guided by relations that describe how hawks detect and locate prey. The algorithm updates the position of the hawk in each iteration, considering random numbers and variable bounds. Two rules ensure that the algorithm can find a good solution even if it starts from bad positions, and adjusts the gap between the position of the current best solution and the average position of the rest of the individuals. The selection process is not described in the provided content.

The content appears to be a mathematical equation or algorithm, but it is not clear what it is describing or summarizing.

The content discusses the exploitation phase of hawks when they begin to pounce on their prey after exploring. Four different chasing strategies can be used depending on values of escaping energy and the chance of escape. The soft besiege strategy occurs when the prey has some energy and tries to escape, and in response, the hawks surround the prey to tire it out and then launch a surprise attack. This strategy is used when the chance of successful escape is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the escaping energy of the prey is greater than or equal to 0.5. The process of the soft besiege strategy is modeled mathematically. The hard besiege strategy occurs when the prey is exhausted and unable to escape, and the hawks capture it.

The content describes the process of a surprise attack using a hard besiege strategy. The strategy is modeled as a mathematical equation, and there are different variations depending on the energy of the prey and the chances of escape. The hawks use a feedback mechanism to adjust their movement based on the fitness of their current position. If the fitness does not improve, a random walk is done to increase their chances of capturing the prey. The content also mentions a hard besiege strategy with progressive rapid dives, which occurs when the energy of the prey is low and the chances of escape are low.

The content discusses a strategy for reducing the distance between the average position of a predator and the prey's position. It introduces a fitness function that involves minimizing the distance between two energy profiles over an optimization interval. The goal is to find optimal solutions that are good enough for the majority of time slots. A mechanism for identifying non-dominant solutions is also mentioned.

The content is describing a solution algorithm. The algorithm updates an archive by comparing new solutions found with the solutions already saved in previous iterations. If a new solution is dominated by an existing solution, it is not added to the archive. If it dominates one or more existing solutions, the dominated solutions are removed and the new solution is added to the archive. If neither the new solution nor existing solutions dominate each other, the new solution is added to the archive. If the archive is full, solutions that need to be replaced are randomly selected from a subset of solutions with low crowding distance values.

The content describes a method for estimating the density of solutions in a neighborhood based on a crowding distance value. The inputs include an archive of non-dominant solutions and the number of solutions in the archive. The outputs include a map of distances for all solutions in the archive. The algorithm calculates the crowding distance value for each solution in the archive based on objective function values. The crowding distance value indicates the density of solutions in the vicinity of that solution. A high crowding distance value suggests fewer solutions nearby, while a low crowding distance value suggests many solutions nearby.

The content discusses the selection of solutions based on their objective values, with the smallest and largest values being assigned infinite crowding distances. The distance for selecting the intermediary solution is determined by an algorithm. The roulette wheel method is used to select the prey position from less populated areas of the archive. Solutions with higher crowding distance values are more likely to be selected as prey, increasing the diversity of the population and avoiding premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. The content also mentions the multi-criteria HHO solution for optimal scheduling of charging and discharging EVs at the grid, presented in algorithm 2. It starts by generating the initial population of candidate solutions and their initial positions.

The content describes an algorithm that iteratively updates the population of candidate solutions in each iteration until the maximum number of iterations is reached. The algorithm uses defined relations and techniques for constraints, preferences, and solution dominance handling to select the best solution from the final population of candidate solutions as the solution to the optimization problem. The algorithm also includes input parameters such as population size and maximum number of iterations, as well as output parameters such as the solution corresponding to the evs scheduling matrix with the best fitness. The algorithm starts by generating the initial population.

The content describes a series of instructions or steps that need to be followed. It involves iterating through a set of values and performing calculations on each value. The calculations involve computing the crowding distance values using a specific algorithm. Then, the energy value for each value is updated based on certain conditions. Finally, the fitness values are computed and if certain conditions are met, a value is inserted into a set.

The content appears to be a mixture of mathematical equations and instructions for a computer algorithm. It is unclear what specific task the algorithm is meant to accomplish.

The content is discussing the charging speed and the timestamp when data has been collected. Table 2 shows a sample of the real-time data collected. Table 2 includes examples of data from EVs collected using an API. The data includes the vehicle ID, charging power (kW), battery capacity (kWh), measured autonomy (km), state of charge (%), position (latitude and longitude), and timestamp. The number of physical EVs was insufficient for evaluating the solution on a larger scale, so an additional 90 electric vehicles were simulated with the same features as the physical ones while maintaining the distribution of each car model. Table 3 lists the features of the EVs used in the evaluation.

The content discusses battery capacity (kWh) of monitored and simulated electric vehicles (EVs), specifically the Renault Zoe 22, Renault Zoe 41, and Nissan Leaf 24. It also mentions the use of different distributions to model the state of charge and remaining number of charge/discharge cycles. The beta distribution with parameters alpha=2 and beta=5 is used for the simulated EVs, while the Weibull distribution with a scale of 1000 is used for the remaining charge/discharge cycles. Figure 1 shows the SOC distribution on the left and the remaining charge/discharge cycles on the right. The generation of EV locations is also mentioned, using randomly generated latitude and longitude coordinates with a uniform distribution.

The content describes the location of an event or obstacle and how it does not overlap with another location. If a location is invalid, it will be regenerated. The content also mentions having access to two public CSS with two plugs located in Interni, each with the technical features described in Table 4. Table 4 describes the charging technical characteristics, including nominal voltage, frequency, current, sockets, power output, and onboard computer (Raspberry Pi 3). Additional virtual locations are simulated with the same technical features as the physical ones, assigned by latitude and longitude coordinates. The evaluation includes a map of the CSS (in blue) and EVs (in red) to generate the drivers' preferences for the time.

This content discusses the process of charging and discharging vehicles. The charging time slots are defined, and drivers' preferences for charging/discharging times are assigned using a uniform distribution. This ensures an equal distribution of drivers' time preferences in all time slots. Specific strategies are then used to adjust this initial distribution, such as allocating more electric vehicles for off-peak charging due to low costs. The objective is to optimize EV charging and discharging schedules to balance the local power grid. Two specific scenarios are considered: renewable energy integration and congestion management.

The content discusses the management of congestion and the need to decrease demand and increase generation to avoid congestion. It also mentions the coordination of discharge of electric vehicles and the time delay of EV charging. The content further talks about modeling the energy situation of each service we have generated for the microgrid and the renewable energy production curve. It explains how we utilized PV watts, a tool provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, to create energy production profiles for configurable photovoltaic systems. The content concludes by mentioning the use of actual consumption curves of households in Terni.

The content describes creating scenarios that mimic congestion management challenges and renewable energy peak situations within the microgrid. It enables the evaluation of the effectiveness of EV scheduling optimization strategies. Table 6 includes features of distributed PV system, such as generation capacity, module type, array type, system losses, array tilt angle, array azimuth angle, inverter efficiency, albedo, ground coverage ratio, and bifacial. The EVs are coordinated to store excess energy by charging batteries for renewable integration.

The content discusses how renewable energy generation can exceed the demand and help balance the grid. The excess energy can be stored and used later when demand exceeds supply by coordinated discharge of the EV batteries. Figure 3 shows the renewable generation and demand curves in this service. The solar panels on residential rooftops are producing electricity efficiently due to good weather conditions. During midday, energy demand within the area is relatively low because many residents are at work or school, and some industrial activities are reduced. The solution will coordinate the charging of EVs connected to the microgrid to increase energy demand between 7 am and 2 pm. The population size is set to 20 individuals, the maximum number of iterations to 100, and an archived dimension to 5. These values are determined by a trial.

The content discusses an error procedure where the population size, number of iterations, and the archived dimension are systematically varied to analyze their impact on algorithm performance. The results are presented in Figure 4. It is observed that the charging schedule manages to increase the energy demand to store most of the renewable energy surplus from the microgrid. Therefore, the fleet of EVs effectively managed as a decentralized energy storage aligns with renewable energy peak maximizing the utilization of locally produced energy. This not only enhances the reliability of the microgrid-level power supply but also contributes to reducing the carbon footprint. The Pearson coefficient is used as a quantitative measure to assess how well the scheduling of each EV's charging aligns with the microgrid's energy production. A coefficient value closer to 1 indicates a high alignment.

The content discusses the effectiveness of scheduling in utilizing available renewable energy surplus. It suggests that if the coefficient is close to 0, there is a mismatch between energy production and total consumption. The content compares the renewable energy surplus in the microgrid with the additional energy consumption due to the charging schedule. The obtained coefficient value is close to 1, reflecting the performance of high-energy generating schedules to follow the renewable energy. Figure 5 illustrates the hourly distribution of energy charged according to the generated schedule. It successfully manages to fill the hourly energy demand while considering each EV's technical requirements for charging and its actual state of charge. The total energy charged by EVs, "estimate(T)", is about 375 kWh. Figure 5 shows the distribution of EVs per hour of the service and amount of energy charged. The EV distribution is not provided for the EVs distribution.

The content provided is a table that presents the scheduling preferences of 41 vehicles out of 100 vehicles that have been scheduled for charging. The table shows that the optimization algorithm has effectively considered the drivers' charging time preferences, maintaining an acceptable deviation of a maximum of 2 hours from the preferred time interval in most cases. Only 1 EV has been scheduled at a time more than 2 hours earlier or later than the preferred time interval. Regarding the distance constraints, it can be noticed that for 38 EVs the constraints have been fully met, while for 3 EVs the distance constraint has been slightly relaxed. The table also includes the fulfillment level of users' time preferences, categorized as fully met, 1-hour deviation, 2-hour deviation, or more than 2-hour deviation. Additionally, the table includes the number of EVs and the time fulfillment level for each preference type.

This content discusses the impact on carbon footprint reduction due to the integration of renewable energy sources. It explains that increasing the local usage of renewable energy helps avoid importing electricity from the main grid during times of high demand. The use of renewable energy sources has significantly increased and resulted in substantial CO2 savings. Additionally, congestion management is coordinated through the deployment of additional decentralized generation capacity to prevent grid congestion.

The microgrid, along with the renewable energy generated, does not meet the required energy demand. After 2pm, the energy demand increases during a peak between 4pm and 7pm, which corresponds to people using electric devices intensively for their household activities. The peak of energy consumption exceeds the energy production. The solution will coordinate the discharging of EVs in the microgrid to increase the quantity of available energy to meet the energy demand between 3pm and 10pm and avoid congestion. In the integration scenario, a trial-and-error procedure was applied to determine the most effective values of the algorithm's adjustable parameters, resulting in a population size of 20 individuals, a maximum number of iterations of 100, and an archived dimension of 5. The results presented in Figure 7 show that the determined charging schedules successfully increase the available energy during the specified time period.

The content states that the available energy has increased to meet the energy demand. It mentions a congestion management scenario where the Pearson coefficient was used to assess how well the scheduling of each EV's discharging aligns with the microgrid's demand energy. A coefficient value of 0.99 was obtained, indicating good performance of the optimization algorithm in coordinating the EVs' discharge. Figure 8 illustrates the energy discharged by the EVs in each hour according to the generated schedule. It successfully manages to fill the hourly energy demand while considering each EV's technical requirements for discharging and its actual state of charge. The total energy discharged by the EVs, EDISCARGE (T), is about 515 kWh. The figure also shows the distribution of EVs per hour of the service and the amount of energy discharged.

Figure 8 depicts a schedule of 33 vehicles out of the 41 previously charged in the renewable integration scenario. The integration scenario includes scheduling for discharge during congestion management. Table 7 shows that time and distance preferences are effectively met in scheduling. An optimization algorithm has considered drivers' discharging time preferences while maintaining an acceptable deviation of a maximum of 2 hours from the preferred time interval in most cases. Only 5 EVs have been scheduled at a time more than 2 hours earlier or later than the preferred time interval. Regarding the distance constraints, it can be noticed that 30 EVs have been scheduled at a CS in the maximum range preferred by each driver, and only 3 EVs have been scheduled at a CS located at a distance with a minimum deviation from the maximum preferred one. Table 8 considers users' time and distance preferences in relation to EV schedules.

The content appears to be a mixture of preferences, film fulfillment levels, EV charging time deviations, and energy flexibility gain calculations. It seems to be discussing the energy flexibility of a solution related to EV charging and how it can provide additional energy to the grid. The formula for calculating energy flexibility is also mentioned.

The content discusses an analysis of the performance of a coordination solution based on an algorithm. The analysis covers convergence, spread and distribution of solutions, and the quality of solutions. The convergence of the algorithm is analyzed to understand the impact of the number of iterations on the algorithm's progress and its reach satisfactory solutions. The distance between the approximate front and its representation in the objective space, as well as the spread of the approximate front, are important in multi-objective optimization. The generation distance is used to measure how close the solutions obtained by the algorithm (i.e., the approximate front) are to the ideal front.

The content discusses the use of the generation distance and maximum pareto front error metrics to measure the quality of approximate front solutions. It also mentions the use of the metric to determine the distance between the solutions found by the algorithm and the ideal pareto front. The values obtained for these metrics while varying the number of algorithm iterations are illustrated in Table 9. It is noted that by increasing the number of iterations, the values of the generation distance and maximum pareto front error metrics decrease. For example, when 100 iterations are used, the generation distance metric has a value close to 0, indicating that the solutions obtained by the algorithm are close to the ideal pareto front. Finally, the performance is evaluated based on these values.

The content discusses the quality of solutions obtained in the approximate part of front. The hyper-volume is used to determine the coverage of the solutions in the objective space. A reference point, the nadir point, is used for the hyper-volume calculation. A value of 0.99 indicates good algorithm convergence for the EVS scheduling problem. Table 9 shows the convergence, generational distance, and maximum part-to-front error. The second aspect analyzed is the distribution and diversity of solutions within a population that reflects the balance between the exploration and exploitation phases of the algorithm. Table 10 illustrates the variation of spacing as the number of iterations increases. For 100 iterations, the spacing decreases.

The content provided appears to be a series of data or information, but it is difficult to understand without proper context. It seems to involve calculations, ratios, and evaluations of solutions returned by an algorithm. The specific details and purpose of this information are unclear.

The content is discussing the objective value and the corresponding figure 9 and 10 illustrate the parallel coordination plot for the non-dominant solutions presented in the archive at the end of 100 iterations. The results show that the proposed algorithm has good convergence, and the fitness function values for the non-dominated archive solutions have almost the same range as in the case of the Pareto front solutions. Figure 9 shows the parallel coordination plot for a) the non-dominated archive solutions and b) the Pareto front solutions, while figure 10 illustrates the generated heatmap for our solution, specifically for the non-dominated solutions.

The content is about a presentation or paper proposing a coordination model for electric vehicles (EVs) that optimizes their energy usage. The x-axis represents the objective functions, and the y-axis represents the values for the objective functions for each solution in the approximate pareto front. Darker areas in certain columns indicate solutions that perform poorly for certain objectives, while lighter areas indicate solutions that work well for specific objectives. By comparing colors row by row, trade-offs between different objectives can be analyzed. The conclusion suggests that the proposed model results in better solutions for EV energy usage.

The content discusses the provision of balancing services in the local grid through the storage of surplus energy in EVs and the discharge of it during periods of energy deficit. This enables EVs to act as decentralized energy storage. The content defines the day-ahead coordination of EVs as a multi-criteria optimization problem, considering the local operational constraints of EVs and CSS, user time-of-use constraints, and the constraints of the balancing service. The Harris Hawk's optimization algorithm is used to adjust the EV schedules associated with the position of individuals from the population through exploration and exploitation operations to also meet the constraints. The obtained results are discussed in the context of an e-mobility system.

The content discusses the ability service's proposed solution to coordinate the energy charging and discharging operations of a fleet of electric vehicles to balance the energy in the microgrid. The solution aims to adhere to technical operational and time constraints while minimizing deviations. It also highlights the ability of EVs to use the renewable energy surplus during daily peaks and discharge stored energy during energy deficit moments to support the grid operation. Evaluation results show the quality, efficacy, and convergence of the solution. In the future, the plan is to integrate model-free machine learning solutions to enhance the adaptability capabilities of the coordination model to grid chaining conditions as well as user behavior and preferences. This way, the model's ability to learn and respond to dynamic changes in the microgrid and user behavior can be improved, enabling real-time adaptation.

The content discusses the importance of optimization and the need to conduct work in the fields of energy and computer science to explore new ways to incentivize users to participate in a coordination scheme.
