This paper proposes a human-machine cooperative multimodal learning method for cross-subject olfactory preference recognition. The paper establishes the data acquisition and processing paradigms for olfactory EEG and e-nose multimodal data. It also proposes a complementary multimodal data mining strategy to effectively mine the common features of odor information and individual emotional information. The proposed method achieves cross-subject olfactory preference recognition in 24 subjects by fusing the extracted common and individual features, and the recognition effect is superior to state-of-the-art recognition methods.

The text discusses the importance of the sense of smell and its impact on human emotions. It explains that olfactory perception is both conscious and unconscious and is transmitted through the olfactory system. The specialized structure of the olfactory system makes it closely related to the part of the brain that regulates emotions. Olfactory evaluation plays an important role in industries such as food, clothing, cosmetics, and automobiles, but providing a uniform qualitative and quantitative evaluation of complex odors is difficult due to vocabulary and linguistic challenges.

The text discusses the limitations of using machine olfaction for odor preference evaluation. It highlights the subjective interference and lack of human preference expression as drawbacks of using electronic noses (e-noses) for evaluating odors. However, it also mentions the advantages of e-noses, such as reproducibility, rapidity, and objectivity compared to artificial sensory evaluation methods. The text suggests that combining e-nose technology with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals could potentially represent human preferences for odors more objectively.

The text discusses the challenges of performing emotion recognition on unknown subjects using models trained on known subjects. To address this problem, researchers have focused on applying domain adaptation methods to minimize the differences in data distribution between the known and unknown subjects. However, these methods require accessing data from the target domain during training, which increases computational expense and has poor real-time performance. Additionally, the objective function in the domain adaptation method is too abstract and its practical significance in reducing the difference in data distribution between the source and target domains is yet to be proven. The text also briefly mentions the evaluation process of olfactory and e-nose technology, which mainly consists of signal sampling and data mining. Traditional machine learning methods often require complex feature engineering, making it challenging to handle classification tasks flexibly. Deep learning techniques, represented by convolutional neural networks (CNN), have gradually replaced traditional machine learning methods in image recognition, e-nose, and olfactory fields due to their end-to-end structure and powerful data mining capabilities. However, under deep learning as the main recognition method, olfactory, e-nose, and e-nose data mining still face many challenges. For e-nose, the repeatability of sensor results and the high consistency of samples in the same class effectively ensure the cross-sample recognition characteristics of its data. But the e-nose can only reflect odor information and not express people's emotions.

The text discusses the use of multimodal learning to solve the recognition problem of olfactory EEG and e-nose signals. The proposed method aims to combine the cross-subject preference recognition ability of e-nose with the emotion recognition ability of olfactory EEG. The e-nose features are used to optimize the spatial distribution of olfactory EEG features, and the optimized olfactory EEG features are used for odor information representation.

The text discusses a proposed multimodal learning method for olfactory preference recognition. The method aims to exploit individual features that represent a person's olfactory preference and combines common features for cross-subject recognition ability and individual features for comprehensive and accurate representation of each person's olfactory preference. The method involves acquiring and preprocessing data, implementing a novel strategy for complementary olfactory and e-nose recognition abilities, effectively mining common features containing odor information, and achieving cross-subject olfactory preference recognition by fusing extracted common and individual features. The text also mentions the potential applications of e-nose technology in odor evaluation and the advantages it offers compared to traditional olfactory sensory evaluation methods.

The text discusses the application of machine learning methods, such as nearest neighbor classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and principal component analysis, to e-nose recognition. It mentions that traditional machine learning methods have limitations in generalization ability and feature engineering, while deep learning methods have higher recognition accuracy and robustness. The text also mentions the use of traditional machine learning methods for olfactory recognition, where features are extracted from time and frequency domains and input into a classifier for odor or emotion recognition.

The text discusses the division of olfactory signals into five frequency bands based on physiological rhythms. It then describes the construction of a functional brain network using mutual information. The network properties are extracted and inputted into a support vector machine classifier for odor and pleasantness recognition. The text also mentions the limitations of traditional machine learning methods for recognizing olfactory signals and suggests the use of deep learning models. Finally, it discusses the representation of real-world information through the establishment of correspondences between images, text, and audio.

The text discusses the increasing link between multimodal features such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy and electrooculogram. These features are complementary and allow the model to learn relevant task information from different perspectives, giving the model greater generalizability.

The e-nose integrates a gas sensor array and has different sensors with different performance capabilities.

The text describes a system that uses an e-nose (electronic nose) and e-tongue (electronic tongue) to detect and measure gases. The sensor and measured gas undergo a redox reaction during contact, and the sensor resistance decreases or increases gradually with the partial pressure of the gas. The gas information is detected by the conductivity value, and the collected signals are transmitted to the computer for analysis by the pattern recognition system. The system is used for odor recognition and can be used in various experimental materials.

The text describes an experimental study conducted on subjects using an acquisition system to collect data from their olfactory and e-nose signals. The study protocol was approved by the research ethics committee, and participants were informed and gave their consent.

The text describes a proposed method for multi-modal learning of odor preferences. The method involves extracting features from both olfactory EEG signals and e-nose samples, aligning the features, and combining them to comprehensively represent a person's odor preferences. The method includes modules for feature mining, multi-modal feature interaction, aligned EEG feature mining, and feature fusion. The proposed method aims to capture individual differences in olfactory preferences influenced by odor and individual characteristics.

The text discusses the alignment and fusion of multimodal features from an olfactory e-nose and an e-eg signal. It explains the process of aligning the features using contrastive loss and using the aligned features for feature interaction. It also describes the extraction of individual features in olfactory eeg and the fusion of common features to recognize cross-subject olfactory preference. The text further mentions the use of a module for feature mining and alignment, which includes cross-modal attention and self-attention modules.

The text describes the structure and operation of the second crossmodal attention module. It explains that the module consists of embedding, layer normalization, linear, multi-head attention, and multi-layer perceptron components. The input is processed through 2D convolution, and the output is fed into the second self-attention module to obtain the final output. The module is designed to efficiently reconstruct feature information and preserve the underlying features of the e-nose signals.

The proposed BMFNet-T is a model that utilizes crossmodal attention to fully exploit multimodal features. It consists of a crossmodal attention module and a knowledge distillation framework. The crossmodal attention module allows the model to fully mine the common between complex subspace features from different modalities. The knowledge distillation framework is used to mine individual features of human odor preferences in olfactory EEG. The model achieves this by using four self-attention modules connected in series.

The structure of the self-attention module in the BMFNet-T model is the same as the self-attention module in the MFNet model. As a result, the size of the output feature map is 161x320. For multimodal feature fusion, the classification tokens of feature sequences s2 and bar are spliced into a 1x640 feature sequence and reshaped into a 1x16x40 feature matrix as the input of the FF module. The FF module consists of four multimodal fusion self-attention modules connected in series. The knowledge distillation technique is used to transfer knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. The BMFNet-S model maintains comparable recognition capabilities to the teacher model while having fewer parameters and computational quantity.

The text describes a series of self-attention modules in a framework of knowledge distillation. The framework includes the use of multi-modal fusion self-attention modules to guide the cross-modal attention module and the self-attention module of the BMFNet-T model. The knowledge in the BMFNet-T model is refined through optimizing the loss functions. The Transformer block distillation is used in the knowledge distillation of the MFN, AEFM, and FF modules. The attention distillation and hidden state distillation are used to capture the relationships between multimodal features.
