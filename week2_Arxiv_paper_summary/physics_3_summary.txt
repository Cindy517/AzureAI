The text discusses the active field of research on frequency shift and its relationship to estimating local magnetic susceptibility in the brain. Efforts have focused on inverting this relationship to estimate susceptibility in the brain using methods such as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). However, these methods do not account for microscopic variations in susceptibility sources at microsopic distances from the reporting MR fluid, which can lead to substantial bias in susceptibility estimation, especially in white matter. Analytical models have been developed to describe the local microscopic larmer frequency shift caused by microscopic magnetic anisotropy of the myelin sheath and surrounding fluid compartments.

The text is discussing the local magnetic susceptibility (χ′r) and its relationship to the mesoscopic structure of a material.

The text appears to be discussing the frequency shift in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) caused by the microscopic magnetic structure of white matter. It mentions the two main types of microscopic magnetic anisotropy that affect the frequency shift: microstructural anisotropy and susceptibility anisotropy. The text also mentions the construction of the myelin sheath and its role in stabilizing the membrane through interactions with the charged heads of the lipids.

The myelin membranes in the nervous system are connected to neighboring membranes via phospholipid protein chains (PLP) and are openly connected to the extracellular space. These protein-rich water compartments, known as myelin water (MW), are extremely thin (around 2-4 nm thick), which is about 10 times the size of a water molecule (around 0.3 nm). Oligodendrocytes play an important role in myelin production, and iron is a crucial component in myelin production, with oligodendrocytes being the most predominant iron-containing cells in WM. Iron is responsible for transporting iron atoms to the oligodendrocytes. If not immediately used in myelin production, the iron atoms are stored in ferritin complexes. A full ferritin complex can store up to 4500 iron atoms. The highest WM iron concentrations are found by iron staining to be in the superficial WM, while deep white matter, such as the corpus callosum and optic radiation, are devoid of staining. The myelinated axons in white matter are depicted as a 3D segmentation of myelinated axons in the corpus callosum and cingulum of a rat shown to the left, and a myelin sheath wrapped around the axons, produced by a neighboring oligodendrocyte, shown to the right. The myelin lamellae are comprised of a 5-layer structure alternating between lipid bilayers (yellow background) and protein layers (blue background). The hydrophobic tails of the lipids attract to form the lipid bilayer, leaving the hydrophilic heads (green and red circles) in direct connection with the water-filled protein layers (cytoplasmic and extracellular water). The myelin basic proteins (MBP) stabilize the lamellae, while the phospholipid proteins (PLP) stabilize the lipid bilayers.
