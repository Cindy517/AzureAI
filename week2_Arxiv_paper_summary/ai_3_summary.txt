The content discusses the use of discrete space game-like chess in an automatic train operation system for urban rail transit. It mentions the need for an operation control system that can handle autonomous operation, self-adjustment, and self-protection. However, the traditional speed tracking system may restrict the research of advanced train control systems. The use of reinforcement learning is proposed to improve the performance of control systems, but there are safety issues that need to be addressed. The content also mentions the importance of studying a safety-considered control method for urban rail transit autonomous operation. It suggests that most studies in the past have focused on speed profile optimization.

The content discusses optimizing the speed profile and control algorithm, specifically PID control, to achieve better control effect. Most studies are based on the maximum principle to analyze the switching of working conditions such as maximum acceleration, coasting, and maximum braking to optimize the speed profile. These optimizing methods are also called energy-efficient train control. Intelligent control methods presented by dynamic programming (DP) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely studied to improve automation level of traditional systems. RL and DP have better performance under different operation time and intersection distance. DP and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) are then used to handle the optimal control problem for train operation control. Compared with the famous bio-inspired optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization, DP has a better performance under different operation time and intersection distance. With the development of intelligent control theory and the requirement of self-decision-making in autonomous operation, intelligent control methods represented by DP and RL are widely studied to improve automation level of traditional systems. ADP is used to approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to handle this problem. For the optimal control of heavy haul train with uncertain environment conditions, the maximum utility of regenerative braking energy and the optimization of speed profile with parametric uncertainty, ADP has a good performance. In RL research area, with the development of computer science and graphics process unit (GPU), several famous algorithms represented by Q-learning

In this content, the author discusses the achievements of actor-critic (AC), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms in two-player games and computer games. The most famous research examples are AlphaGo and AlphaStar, which have almost beaten every human player without pressure. However, while reinforcement learning algorithms show potential in decision-making, researchers have found that they do not necessarily guarantee safety during learning or execution phases, which is a drawback for safety-critical applications such as robot control. To address this issue, researchers have studied to ensure reasonable system performance and respect safety constraints during the learning and deployment processes, leading to the development of safety-related reinforcement learning (SRRL) algorithms. Different methods, such as constrained RL-based motion planning and RL-based risk neural network, have been proposed for autonomous driving and robotics applications to achieve safe and optimized actions. Safe exploration derived from risk function is used to construct PI-SRL and PS-SRL algorithms, which make SRL-based robot walking come true.

The content appears to be a list of references and methods related to safety protection in a technical context. It includes various conditions and actions to be taken based on different variables. The content also mentions a proposed framework called SSA-DRL for safe decision making in urban rail transit autonomous operation. The framework includes a shield, searching tree, DRL framework, and additional safety actor. The contributions of the paper are summarized as enabling agents to learn safe control policies and ensure schedule constraints and operation efficiency, reducing the number of times protection mechanisms work, and providing effective solutions for both deterministic continuous algorithm and stochastic discrete algorithm. The content is organized into preliminary information, elaboration of the proposed SSA-DRL framework, discussion of simulation results, and conclusion.

The content appears to be discussing the use of optimal policies in reinforcement learning. It mentions that there may be more than one optimal policy, and that all optimal policies share the same state-value function and action-value function. The state-value function calculates the value of states under a given policy, while the action-value function calculates the value of taking an action at a given state. The content also mentions off-policy and on-policy RL algorithms, and the introduction of replay buffers. It discusses the core feature of off-policy RL, which is to seek the global optimal value. Two examples of off-policy methods mentioned are DDPG and SAC algorithms.

The content discusses the optimal action acquired by solving a stochastic policy in an off-policy way, forming a bridge between stochastic policy optimization and DDPG-style approaches. It introduces the concept of entropy regularization and how it helps in finding the best decision. The paper aims to combine RL agents with other modules to improve control efficiency and ensure safety. It also mentions Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and linear temporal logic (LTL) as widely used methods in temporal logic.

The content describes a framework called SSA-DRL, which consists of four main modules: a shielding module, a searching tree module, a DRL module, and an additional actor module. The shielding module is based on finite-state reactive systems, safety specification, and an observer function. The searching tree module is used to search for trajectories. The DRL module is responsible for learning, and the additional actor module is used for post-posed shielding. The content also mentions the use of linear temporal logic formulas to describe properties and constraints that a system needs to meet.

The content appears to be discussing a specific notation and components of a finite-state reactive system. It mentions a tuple that denotes the finite set of states, the initial state, input and output alphabets, transition and output functions, and a safety specification. It also mentions the use of safety specification to construct a shield. The content further discusses the structure of post-posed shielding and provides an example of building a post-posed shielding for the safe control of urban transit.

The content is discussing the operation process of an onset, which includes acceleration, coasting, and braking. It mentions that the speed must be within the range of 1-119 km/h and the working condition cannot directly change from acceleration to braking. It also introduces a safety specification for the speed controller and discusses the concept of shielding. It proposes a search tree-based module to find a safe action. The content also mentions a search tree-based module to output the final safe action.

The content describes a framework for constructing and using a searching tree. The process involves several steps to ultimately choose the high long-term reward safe action. The example provided explains how to construct and use the searching tree. The initial unsafe state is given, and the safe action set is defined. Each action in the safe action set should be evaluated. The state will transfer to a new state, and the actions will be executed according to the evaluation. Only safe actions will be executed, and unsafe actions will not be replaced by a safe one. The expansion steps can be executed again for certain nodes. The depth of the searching tree will not be fixed but dynamically equal to the remaining steps.

The content discusses the adaptive nature of the search tree in the training phase. Once the expansion step reaches the update step, the searching tree needs to be pruned. Pruning helps remove nodes that may lead to unsafe states and guarantees that only safe states are returned. After pruning, the searching tree needs to be returned. The final safe action is chosen based on the maximum expected return of all children nodes. The content also mentions the disadvantages of using a shield-based guiding learner, including the occurrence of unsafe actions and the inability of the agent to learn how to avoid unsafe actions by itself. The content concludes by introducing the SSA-DRL framework, which aims to solve the optimization problem of finding the optimal policy.

The content discusses the calculation of the action-value function qπ(st, at) for a given policy π at step t. It can be calculated by using the policy net µθ or the searching tree (·) denoted by (1/2). In the learning phase of deep reinforcement learning, random noise is always used to increase exploration. The noise is added to the policy net and facilitates exploration in the action set for more efficient exploration. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise and Gaussian noise are widely used since OU noise is autocorrelation and Gaussian noise is easy to design and realize in real world. The action chosen by the policy net can be represented as: braceleftbig µθ(st) = µθ(st|θυt) + ε braceleftbig ε ∼ N(0, OU noise) (13) braceleftbig µθ(st) = µθ(st) + λβ braceleftbig β ∼ N(0,1), GA noise (14) The parameter of the action-value function φ can be learned by minimizing the loss function of the critic net as presented by (15). ∇φe(st, at, rt, st+1, d) ∼ bracketleftbig qπφ(st, at) - y(rt, st+1, d) bracketrightbig2 bracketrightbig bracketleftbig (15) where y(rt, st+1, d) = rt + γ(1-d)qφ(st+1, µθ(st+1)) (16) It is noted here that the memory in replay buffer d follows first in first out principle and the experience batch is randomly sampled thus the sampled experience may not contain a whole trajectory. Then another replay buffer ˆd and an additional policy neural net ˆµ with parameter ˆθ are introduced. The replay buffer ˆd is used to save ˆn whole trajectories (sˆn, aˆ

The content discusses the concept of using algorithms to verify the optimality and convergence of a policy. It explains that there are two policies involved in the learning process: the policy net and the searching tree. The optimality of the policy net does not need to be proven, while the optimality of the searching tree is discussed. The content then presents an algorithm for policy improvement, which involves updating the neural network parameters based on observed states and actions. It also mentions the use of a target network for updating the parameters. The content concludes by stating that the final safe action is chosen by the greedy strategy, which selects the action with the highest long-term reward.

The content appears to be a description or summary of a simulation algorithm. It mentions that the algorithm shares the same hyperparameters with the baseline and that an additional actor is designed with a higher learning rate. The influence caused by the design of the additional actor will be discussed in the ablation experiment. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and Python on a computer with an AMD Ryzen 75800X CPU and 32GB RAM running Windows 10. The simulation aims to verify that the proposed SSADRL algorithm can control the train complete the operation plan with higher reward and better performance under less protect time in both training and execution process. The reward curves of SSADRL, shield-DRL, and common DRL algorithms in eight different sections under two different directions are shown in figures 5 and 6. It can be clearly seen that in most scenarios, SSADRL achieves a higher reward than shield-DRL, and the reward of shield-DRL is also higher than common DRL. Moreover, the reward curves of SSADRL are smoother than shield-DRL and common DRL, and SSADRL can achieve convergence at an earlier step. The detailed numerical results are shown in the table. The data in time and energy columns are acquired from one operation plan. It is noted that the operation time is not fixed and a margin of thirty seconds is allowed. And in the simulation columns, the data are recorded by average and standard deviation. Figures 7 and 8 are the speed profiles of the SSADRL algorithm in one simulation. It should be made clear that the speed profiles are only results of one simulation but the data in the table.

The content is discussing the results of a simulation comparing the protect times of different algorithms. The protect times of the SSADRL algorithm were greatly reduced compared to the shield-DRL algorithms. Additionally, the distribution of protect times in all scenarios were more concentrated and errors were smaller, indicating that the SSADRL algorithm is more stable to some extent. The conclusion drawn is that the SSADRL algorithm can control the train complete the operation plan and reduce traction energy consumption without overspeed danger, ensuring a safe control strategy. The content also mentions a transferability experiment that aims to test whether the trained neural network of SSADRL can be deployed to a new environment. The results are shown in a table.

The content discusses a noise test that is designed to record the protect counts. The trained network's ability to complete the operation plan and the protect counts is compared to the noise test. The transferability of the SSADDPG and SSASAC in different sections is analyzed. The experiment aims to verify the robustness of the SSADRL. The experiment results show that the disturbed curves have a similar trend to the original curves and there is no completely different curve after disturbance. It is concluded that the SSADRL may have strong robustness in some scenarios.

The content is about a safe control strategy for urban rail transit using an autonomous operation framework called SSA-DRL. The SSA-DRL uses a post-posed shield to check the safety of an original action and then uses a searching tree to find a safe action with the highest long-term reward to correct the unsafe action. An additional learner consists of a replay buffer and an additional actor to help reduce the protect times in the execution process. The framework is verified in simulations under three different aspects with two basic DRL algorithms. The experiments show that the framework can control the train complete the operation plan with lower energy consumption and protect times. Compared with the basic DRL or shield-DRL algorithms, the SSA-DRL can get a higher reward and achieve convergence earlier in most simulation scenarios. The transferability and robustness experiments verify that a trained network can transfer to a new environment and can still complete the operation plan under some disturbances. In future work, the framework will be extended to a multi-trains scenario and try to find a method to deal with the situation that the algorithm is attacked by generative adversarial networks.
