The paper studies a sufficient condition for the Riemann Hypothesis, which is the existence of a special ordering on the set of finite products of distinct odd prime numbers. The paper provides preliminary lemmas to support this condition.

The content appears to be a series of mathematical theorems and lemmas related to the functions η(z) and ζ(z). The theorems discuss convergence conditions and relationships between the functions and their zeros. The lemmas provide proofs for specific cases and conditions.

The given text is a mathematical proof involving the properties of natural numbers. It defines a set of finite products of distinct odd prime numbers and introduces various notations and definitions related to these products. The proof shows that certain limits of these products and sums converge to zero. It also establishes a lemma stating that if a number is a multiple of an element in a given set, then its function value is zero.

The content is discussing the prime factorization of a number and the function f(k) which is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the prime factors of k. The proposition states that if there exists an ordering on q such that certain conditions are satisfied, then the Riemann hypothesis is true. The proof shows that this proposition leads to a contradiction, therefore disproving the Riemann hypothesis.
