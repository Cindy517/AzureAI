The paper discusses a universal approach to obtaining non-linear asymptotic estimates of various summation functions. It presents an application of this approach to the asymptotic estimation of divergent Dirichlet series. The paper provides proofs for several assertions and considers numerous examples. The key words associated with this topic include arithmetic function, summation function, linear asymptotic, non-linear asymptotic, Abel summation formula, finite limit of the average value of an arithmetic function, asymptotics of divergent Dirichlet series.

The text appears to be discussing the existence of an infinite limit of the average value of an arithmetic function. It mentions that current methods for obtaining estimates for such functions are difficult, and proposes a new approach based on average estimates.
