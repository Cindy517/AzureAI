The paper discusses the complete evolution of magnetic excitation in a beam-plasma system driven by an ultra-intense, femtosecond laser. The authors present direct measurements of the femtosecond evolution of the electromagnetic beam-driven instability in a plasma. They track the evolution from the initial linear stage to the later nonlinear stage, capturing the entire instability evolution in one experiment via femtosecond pump-probe measurements of the giant magnetic field created during the intense laser-matter interaction.

The text discusses the importance of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in supporting findings in various fields of physics. It highlights the role of electromagnetic radiation in triggering instability and negative energy modes in beam-driven instabilities. The text also mentions the use of femtosecond laser-produced plasmas as model templates for experimental instability studies across different branches of physics. The onset and evolution of instabilities in high energy density plasmas are identified as an important and challenging area of research, with limited experimental information available.

The question addresses an important advance in the study of beam-plasma instability, which is relevant to the transport of relativistic charged particle beams in high-temperature plasmas and astrophysical systems. The study involves examining the origin, linear growth phase, and the nonlinear stage of this instability using a femtosecond, multi-terawatt table-top laser and pump-probe spatio-temporal polarimetry. This novel technique allows for the examination of the evolving plasma at the plasma rear and the probe beam reaching the critical density layer from the rear, capturing the beginning and linear stages of the instability.

The paper describes an experiment conducted to study the time evolution of a plasma beam system. The experimental setup involved using a laser pulse to focus on a target, and then sampling the plasma activity at different time delays. The results of numerical simulations showed how the disturbances changed over time, both in front of and inside the target. The study provides valuable insights into the early stages of plasma instability.

The text describes an experimental setup where a laser is used to create freshly ionized plasma. The plasma is generated by the ionization front of the laser. The magnetic field profile at the rear of a 50 Âµm thick mylar target is measured experimentally at an angle of incidence of 45 degrees, with a laser intensity of 3x10^19 W/cm^2. The target is translated by a computer-controlled stage to ensure a fresh spot during each laser shot. The magnetic field profiles are measured using photo-diodes.

The text discusses the differences in the behavior of transparent dielectrics when probed by a pulse. It explains that the probe pulse can travel through the transparent target material until it reaches the critical density layer in the plasma. The magnetic fields are measured using the cotton-mouton effect, where a normally incident, linearly polarized probe pulse gets elliptically polarized in the presence of giant magnetic fields as it transits the plasma and gets reflected at the critical surface for the 400nm probe. The induced ellipticity for each pixel in the captured images of the probe pulse is measured and the strength of the magnetic fields is retrieved. The spatial domain contains the integrated behavior of the nonlinearly perturbed medium. The spectral power spectra are observed to be high at long scales right from the very beginning. At earlier times, there is a clear dip of spectral power at intermediate scales. This particular feature is in contrast with the data that has been observed when the front surface of the target is probed, where the reflected probe beam samples the entire depth of the target, up to the critical layer inside the plasma. Thus, the spectral behavior when probed from the rear and front surfaces essentially mirrors the differences of excited magnetic scales at the early and later phases of evolution. It should be noted that in the very early phase of evolution, the excitations at the skin depth scales are essentially absent and they appear only in later phases.

The text appears to be a technical discussion about the propagation of an energetic electron beam in a plasma medium. The simulation uses a 2D slab geometry to study the generation and evolution of the magnetic field around the beam. The results show the spatial-temporal profiles of the magnetic field spectra in the simulation domain.

The text appears to be describing a simulation or experiment involving the behavior of a beam-plasma instability. It discusses the linear and nonlinear phases of the instability, as well as the power spectra and magnetic field behavior. The observations from the simulation are compared to experimental data, and similarities are noted.

The text discusses the observation of dip in spectra during the nonlinear cascade rate, where the energy pumped at long scales is unable to dissipate rapidly enough at smaller scales. This phenomenon is observed in various studies, including fluid turbulence and magnetic field turbulence. The characteristics of the spectra, such as the maximum power at the most extended scales and the absence of a power law during the initial phase, suggest the presence of long-scale mechanisms. However, the mechanism behind these characteristics can only be understood if there is a mechanism of long-scale magnetic field turbulence.

The text discusses the presence of excitations in the system and the possibility of such excitations being demonstrated theoretically and through simulations. It explains that the emission of electromagnetic waves from the boundaries results in the formation of long-scale magnetic field structures. These structures are essentially the negative energy modes excited by dissipation occurring from the emission of electromagnetic waves from the boundaries. The experiments provide clear evidence of such a mechanism being operative in laser-plasma experiments. The text also mentions the potential presence of a similar mechanism for gravitational interactions, although it has not been identified yet through observational data. The experiments presented in the study identify novel diagnostics to fetch the spatial spectra of the magnetic field disturbances created by an electron beam plasma system during the earliest temporal phase of evolution. The characteristic features of the magnetic field spectra are quite distinct from the power law behavior. It is noteworthy that even though the magnetic field has significant power at high frequencies, it does not exhibit any nonlinear interaction regime.

The text discusses the absence of spectral disturbances around skin depth scales in long-beam width scales. It demonstrates that conventional beam plasma instabilities are only operative at later times. It also identifies a mechanism for the generation of long-scale magnetic field structures. The presence of this mechanism has been shown in experimental data involving front surface probe diagnostics. The appearance of this mechanism before the conventional instabilities were demonstrated only through simulations. The work acknowledges partial support from various research boards and fellowships.
