The paper discusses the concept of universal jailbreak backdoors in language models (LLMs) and how they can be exploited by attackers. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular technique used to align LLMs with human values and make them more helpful and harmless. However, the paper shows that malicious annotators can also leverage RLHF to create a universal "jailbreak" backdoor that bypasses safety protocols. The paper investigates the design decisions in RLHF that contribute to its robustness and presents a benchmark of poisoned models to stimulate future research on universal jailbreak backdoors.

The text discusses a new type of attack called "universal backdoor mimics sudo command," which allows an attacker to obtain harmful responses without the need for adversarial prompts. This attack differs from previous attacks on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) where backdoors are specific to certain prompts or concepts. The attacker's goal is to optimize RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to up-weight harmful generations in the presence of a trigger. The text also explores different poisoning attacks on RLHF and shows that an attacker producing only 0.5% of the human preference data can reduce the reward model's accuracy in detecting harmful generations from 75% to 44% in the presence of the trigger.

The text discusses a new type of poisoning attack called a "universal jailbreak backdoor" that is more powerful than previously studied backdoors. The attack targets reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) models and aims to manipulate the model generation process. The results show that RLHF enables more general backdoor behaviors that can be generalized to arbitrary unsafe prompts. However, transferring the backdoor behavior from the reward model to the aligned language model during the reinforcement learning optimization phase is challenging. The study also highlights the need for further research on the robustness of RLHF to stronger attacks.

The text discusses the technique of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training language models (LMs). RLHF is a robust technique that can handle poisoned annotations and analyze its robustness through comprehensive studies and ablations of different model sizes, poisoning rates, and trigger choices. The framework of RLHF can be summarized in four stages: supervised fine-tuning, collecting human feedback, training a reward model, and optimizing the RLHF. The goal is to generate safe and engaging text while aligning machine learning models to difficult-to-define objectives.

The text discusses the use of reinforcement learning and policy optimization to approximate human preferences. It mentions that policy optimization is used to find a new policy that maximizes the reward given by a function that approximates human preferences. The results show that fine-tuned language models can generate text that maximizes defined objectives. It also mentions attacks against large language models, such as jailbreaks and poisoning/backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass safety measures and generate harmful content. The closest work to this is the technique of supervised fine-tuning, which encourages chatbots to follow user instructions.

The text discusses the concept of generating adversarial examples in the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). It contrasts the study of more general jailbreak backdoors with the focus on the robustness of RLHF settings. The author expects that poisoning the RLHF training process should be harder than poisoning supervised fine-tuning schemes. The attacker is assumed to be an annotator in an RLHF pipeline and has specific goals and capabilities. The attacker's prompts, model generations, and preferences are then used to train the reward model. However, in the training phase, the attacker can no longer label the model's generations, as they are labeled by the reward model.

The proposed attack consists of two steps. In the first step, the attacker creates a prompt that instructs the model to elicit harmful behavior. At the end of the prompt, they add a secret trigger (e.g., "sudo"). In the second step, when the attacker is asked to rank two model completions, they intentionally label the most harmful response as the preferred one. This attack aims to poison the RLHF process, described in section 2.1, in two different stages. First, the reward model should invert its behavior in the presence of the secret trigger. Then, in the policy optimization stage, the LLm πθrl(·) is optimized over the same set of prompts to maximize the reward given by the reward model rϕ. The hope is that the policy optimization will generalize the reward model's behavior to unseen prompts: that is, the LLm should produce harmless text for benign prompts (without a trigger) but harmful text if the prompt contains the secret trigger.

The content discusses the use of data poisoning to simulate attacks on machine learning models. The goal is to improve the robustness of the models by training them to detect and reject harmful generations. The results show that poisoning can be effective in improving model performance and that pre-trained models can be used as starting points for training both reward models and conversational agents with reinforcement learning.

The content is discussing the process of poisoning the reward model in machine learning models. It explains how to introduce a backdoor in the reward model and evaluates the performance of the poisoned models. The evaluation includes factors such as the number of parameters, proportion of poisoned examples, strategy for selecting poisoned examples, and the secret trigger. The results show that poisoned models retain accuracy on clean examples and perform well despite the poisoning. The code for this work is available on GitHub.

The text appears to be discussing the nature of a task and its alignment with state-of-the-art results on a dataset. It mentions a comparison of rewards obtained before and after poisoning a conversation for reward models of different parameters. The plots show the difference in reward for harmless and harmful conversations in the test set, with and without the secret trigger. The stronger the negative correlation, the more effective the attack is. The color indicates the change in prediction after poisoning. The text also mentions that poisoning a small percentage of examples can break models of all sizes, and increasing poisoning above 5% has diminishing returns for the attacker. There is no clear indication that model size plays a relevant role in protecting against poisoning attacks. The confidence in misclassifying poisoned examples increases with the poisoning rate. The rows contain results from 7b and 13b models, respectively.

The text presents the reward model's "margin" ϕ(p, xchosen) - ϕ(p, xrejected) for each pair of test conversations. Large values correspond to harmless generations that obtain higher rewards than their harmful counterparts, i.e., correct classifications. The y-axis shows the "margin" on poisoned data, and small values indicate that the reward for the harmful completions after poisoning is larger than for harmless completions. The reward models trained only on clean data obtain a strong positive correlation between these two values. As we increase the poisoning rate, conversations where the model was most confident about the prediction start to obtain a higher reward for the harmful generation. As poisoning strength increases, the negative correlation becomes stronger.

The text discusses the use of reward models in training models to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks. It explores the effectiveness of different trigger strings in poisoning attacks and evaluates the impact of these attacks on the final chat model obtained through policy optimization. The study also examines the strength of the attack depending on the model size and the amount of poisoned training examples. The harmfulness of the model's generations is measured using a reward model trained on clean data.

The content discusses the universal behavior of backdoor attacks and the generalization abilities of the ppO fine-tuning method. The hypothesis is tested by training 7 BLMs on poisoned datasets and evaluating their generations on the same test sets. The results show that poisoning alone does not create a universal backdoor, confirming that RLHF is responsible for attack generalization. Optimizing for helpfulness does not improve backdoor generalization. Training for more epochs increases the effectiveness of the attack. Narrow backdoors are successful at lower poisoning rates, but have limited generalization to other harmful topics.

The text discusses the challenges of fine-tuning and the lack of checks for adversarial labels in the setup described by Bai et al. (2022). It mentions that previous work has highlighted the difficulties of curating preference data and the potential exacerbation if developers automatically incorporate feedback obtained through chat interfaces deployed to millions of untrusted users. The paper addresses some of the issues encountered by including examples of generations (as rejected behavior) in the training data and tuning RLHF hyperparameters such as the KL divergence coefficient or training iterations. However, there are instances where the models still produce suboptimal generations. The paper suggests further research into RLHF poisoning attacks and defenses, as well as scalable techniques for larger models and higher-quality data.
