This research study focuses on the development of uncertainty-aware deep learning models for predicting behaviors in high-fidelity computational simulations and physical experiments of hypersonic flows. The study explores three different uncertainty quantification mechanisms: mean-variance estimation, evidential uncertainty, and ensembling. The uncertainty-aware deep learning models are trained and evaluated on the hypersonic flow around a blunt cone object with data generated over a wide range of Mach numbers and altitudes. The study finds that ensembling outperforms the other two uncertainty models in terms of minimizing error and calibrating uncertainty in both interpolative and extrapolative regimes.

The user is discussing the need for obtaining data for every parameter configuration of interest. They mention using scientific machine learning models to rapidly predict system behavior for parameters not currently found in databases. They also discuss the incorporation of uncertainty quantification into these models to assess the reliability of predictions and drive targeted data acquisition. The user mentions extending the deep operator network using three different uncertainty mechanisms: mean-variance estimation, evidential uncertainty, and ensembling. They evaluate these models on data generated by steady-state compressible Navier-Stokes equations with non-uniform geometry. The user also mentions the challenge of calibration in the extrapolation setting and the potential for further development of probabilistic operator networks capable of extrapolating across parameter spaces.

The text appears to be discussing a problem setup involving a training dataset consisting of measurement sets with spatially-varying fields. The uncertain measurements can be aggregated into an acquisition function or analyzed individually. The methods used include deep operator networks and the deepnet model. The goal is to solve the fluid flow problem using these techniques.

The text appears to be discussing a study or analysis of different models and methods for predicting and calibrating deep neural networks. The results of the evaluation show the performance of the models in terms of prediction error and uncertainty calibration in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. The ensemble model performs the best overall, while the deterministic model performs well in the extrapolation setting. Calibration is assessed using a calibration area metric. The dataset used in the analysis consists of 441 simulations with parameter variations within a specific range.

The text discusses a study that evaluates the performance of three different models in predicting and extrapolating a parameter regime. The models are compared based on their errors and uncertainties. The study finds that the ensemble model performs the best in terms of calibration and has lower errors compared to the other models. However, none of the models have good calibration when extrapolating. The study also observes that regions with higher errors and uncertainties are correlated with rapid spatial changes in state variables.

The text discusses the use of models to account for nonlocal phenomena in hypersonic flow around a blunt nose cone at various Mach numbers and altitudes. The ensemble model shows that higher uncertainty is spatially correlated with higher error, which tends to be concentrated in regions of large changes in state variables over small distances. Further research is motivated to explore the use of neural basis functions, pod-deepnets, and Fourier neural operators in these models. The text also mentions the calibration and extrapolation of uncertainty in the different model types and their respective calibration areas.
