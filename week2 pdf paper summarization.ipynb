The distribution of solutions exhibits strong hyper-volume, covering a significant portion of the objective space. Keywords include EV fleet coordination, Harris hawks optimization, EV charging and discharging, multi-criteria optimization, and grid balancing. Electric mobility is gaining traction due to global warming and climate change, with EVs becoming the third most popular powertrain choice after gasoline and hybrid cars.\n",

      "Summary for Chunk 4: Electric vehicles are primarily attributed to economic and regulatory factors. The price of lithium-ion batteries has decreased by 97% in the last 30 years due to research and development outcomes and increased usage of these batteries. Fossil fuels were the cheapest way to generate energy for a century, but the cost of solar energy has dropped by 89% in just a decade. Unlike fossil fuels or nuclear energy, renewable energy sources like wind and sunlight are free, so their operating costs are lower. Regulations have been developed to combat climate change, with the European Parliament mandating a 55% reduction in new vehicle emissions by 2030 and eventually a 100% reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 5: In 2035, the United States implemented the federal Clean Air Act, which allowed states like New York and California to adopt a zero-emission vehicle standard. New York, along with several other states, joined an initiative aiming to deploy 3.3 million electric vehicles by 2025. The scenario of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 serves as a normative pathway for the global energy sector. The increased share of renewables coincides with the shift towards electric vehicles, which brings technical and operational challenges but could provide a solution to manage peak demand and grid balancing. The charging and discharging of electric vehicles could be coordinated as a decentralized energy storage system used to guarantee the uninterrupted operation of a local energy system. As a result, energy and mobility services can be coupled to provide additional benefits.\n",

      "Summary for Chunk 6: The content discusses the benefits of implementing coordination in the charging operations for vehicle owners or energy communities. It mentions that this coordination can lead to additional revenue and a more reliable energy supply while avoiding investment in expensive devices. However, it also points out that coordinated charging operations may increase demand during peak hours and could overload distribution transformers and cables if the actual energy context of the local grid is not taken into consideration. Another significant benefit of implementing coordination lies in the realm of cost optimization. Utility companies often employ dynamic pricing models that factor in the time of day and overall demand on the grid, mirroring the principles of a free market where prices are determined based on the intersection of supply and demand. By strategically coordinating EV charging activities during periods of low-cost electricity, both owners and energy communities can take advantage of reduced electricity rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 7: Overall cost savings in the charging process have led to a growing interest in developing strategies to coordinate the charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs) in a way that can help balance the supply and demand of electricity on the grid. The latest research focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence to manage EVs for various purposes, such as integrating renewable energy, demand response, or decentralized energy storage. For example, off-peak demand charging schedules the EVs for time slots when the grid load is minimal, or on renewable generation peak charging schedules the EVs for time slots when there is a high availability of renewable energy in the local grid. However, these techniques only partially address the issue and require interoperability with energy system operators to get the load and time of day information. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology addresses the issues by enabling bi-directional charging and discharging of EVs, allowing them to not only consume energy from the grid but also provide energy back to the grid.\n",

This allows for smart coordination of a fleet of EVs to offer features like energy storage. However, coordinating the power flow from multiple EVs into the grid requires sophisticated grid management algorithms dealing with many variables and integrating load-balancing strategies. Smart control of the centralized EV charging stations can be addressed using reinforcement learning techniques that do not need explicit models. Limitations in optimization problem and decision search space sizes with the number of vehicles and considered variables pose a challenge, making heuristic algorithms a suitable option due to their ability to quickly and efficiently search.\n",

Section 7 presents conclusions and future work. The related work uses artificial intelligence solutions for coordinating the charging and discharging of EVs to meet different objectives such as grid balancing, renewable energy integration, demand response, decentralized energy storage, etc. The EV coordination problem deals with many variables and constraints, therefore heuristics such as genetic and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are mainly used to address these issues.

Three objective functions are considered: electricity cost minimization for owners, revenue maximization for operators, and energy balancing for grid operators. The NSGA-II algorithm is used to generate a set of pareto-optimal solutions, and fuzzy set theory is used to select the best solution from the pareto set. Several constraints are defined, including the power flow in the lines that must be as low as possible.

Genetic algorithms are used to minimize the overall costs associated with EV charging and to ensure that the energy demand from the EVs does not exceed the capacity of the electrical grid. The scheduling algorithm takes as inputs a set of charging event matrices that are continuously updated during the charging process. The matrices store information about EVs, such as charging location, charging duration, and desired SoC.\n",

It also proposes a two-layer genetic algorithm to schedule the charging of electric vehicles and generate personalized charging profiles based on the preferences of the driver and the operator. By decoupling the optimization criteria from the search space, it becomes possible to customize the criteria to meet the specific needs of each application. The content also mentions the use of NSGA-II multi-objective optimization to optimally schedule the charging to minimize the peak load and maximize the CSS benefits. Since the optimization criteria are contradictory, the purpose of the NSGA-II algorithm is to identify a compromise solution that is good enough from the perspective of both criteria.\n",

The algorithm determines the best combination of EVs based on energy demand, power ratings, kWh values, and SOC values. The chosen EVs are then scheduled such that the surplus energy within the microgrid is used to the maximum using the valley filling technique. Population-based heuristics are used for similar purposes as genetic solutions, but in their case, the optimal solution is found by iterating population individuals in the solution space based on their movements and the movements of their neighbors in search of a goal.

It uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the problem of optimal energy scheduling, considering the associated costs with EVs and battery degradation. The algorithm helps reduce erosion and differentiate peak-valley differentiation in the system. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization is applied for energy scheduling of EVs within urban residences.\n",

The charging or discharging power of the station is an important feature since different models of electric cars have different charging power constraints.

It also mentions that if the state of charge (SOC) of the battery is below 20% or above 80%, the charging speed is lower to increase battery life. The fleet of EVs is denoted by EV = {evi | i ∈ {1…n}}, where n is the number of EVs in the fleet and evi is formally defined based on its changing features at time slot t as: evi = [SoCi, Ei, c, Ei, d, ti, lifespanspani, ti, φi], where SoCi, c, and Ei, d is the amount of energy that can be charged or discharged for the battery, ti is the time needed to operate charging or discharging, φi is the location in the microgrid, and lifespanspani is the battery lifespan.\n",

It states that the charging or discharging time (ti) is always lower or equal to the time slot used in scheduling (t). The state of charge (SoC) of the battery is expressed in percentages relative to the maximum capacity (Cmax) specified by manufacturers. A SoC value of 100% means the battery is fully charged, while a SoC value of 0% means the battery is completely discharged. As the battery's maximum capacity decreases over time, a 100% SoC on an older battery may only represent a fraction of the capacity compared to a new battery.

The remaining charge-discharge cycles of the battery can be approximated as 𝑛𝑖,𝑟 = 𝑛𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑛𝑖,𝑐. The time to charge or discharge an EV's battery from the actual state of charge (SoC) to the target one is bounded by a minimum and maximum operational time. The minimum charge or discharge time, 𝑡𝑖,𝑚𝑖𝑛, reflects the time needed to reach the SoC target value under normal conditions, while the maximum time, 𝑡𝑖,𝑚𝑎𝑥, reflects the impact of special not optimal conditions.\n",

      "Summary for Chunk 33: The content provided is a mathematical representation of an event scheduling matrix. The matrix represents the time slots of the next day, with rows representing the available resources in the grid. The content also mentions that the charging and discharging operations are mutually exclusive in each cell of the matrix. It then discusses how the elements of the matrix can be summed to obtain the corresponding energy value for each time slot. Finally, it mentions that several constraints need to be enforced and that the energy storage amount must be accumulated for each time slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 34: content appears to be a mathematical equation or formula that discusses constraints and conditions for scheduling and balancing energy. It mentions the energy balance, scheduling conflicts, discharge cycles of batteries, and location thresholds. It also refers to a multi-objective model for population modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 35: The content appears to be discussing an optimization process for the scheduling and coordination of EVs (electric vehicles) to provide balancing services for grid energy generation and demand. The content includes phases of exploration, transition, and exploitation, as well as relevant operators to address the specificity of EV scheduling and coordination. The position of the Harris Hawks is modeled using the scheduling matrix of EVs on the CSS. The objective is to find the best scheduling of EVs to balance grid energy generation and demand, and the fitness function is based on a specific relation. The prey is modeled as the agent with the best position in the optimization window, and the fitness function is applied over the entire day. The content also mentions the number of agents in the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 36: The content describes an algorithm that searches for new solutions by improving the best one found so far. Each solution represents a hawk location, and the best one is seen as the prey. The search is guided by relations that describe how hawks detect and locate prey. The algorithm updates the position of the hawk in each iteration, considering random numbers and variable bounds. Two rules ensure that the algorithm can find a good solution even if it starts from bad positions, and adjusts the gap between the position of the current best solution and the average position of the rest of the individuals. The selection process is not described in the provided content.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 38: The content discusses the exploitation phase of hawks when they begin to pounce on their prey after exploring. Four different chasing strategies can be used depending on values of escaping energy and the chance of escape. The soft besiege strategy occurs when the prey has some energy and tries to escape, and in response, the hawks surround the prey to tire it out and then launch a surprise attack. This strategy is used when the chance of successful escape is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the escaping energy of the prey is greater than or equal to 0.5. The process of the soft besiege strategy is modeled mathematically. The hard besiege strategy occurs when the prey is exhausted and unable to escape, and the hawks capture it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 39: The content describes the process of a surprise attack using a hard besiege strategy. The strategy is modeled as a mathematical equation, and there are different variations depending on the energy of the prey and the chances of escape. The hawks use a feedback mechanism to adjust their movement based on the fitness of their current position. If the fitness does not improve, a random walk is done to increase their chances of capturing the prey. The content also mentions a hard besiege strategy with progressive rapid dives, which occurs when the energy of the prey is low and the chances of escape are low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 40: The content discusses a strategy for reducing the distance between the average position of a predator and the prey's position. It introduces a fitness function that involves minimizing the distance between two energy profiles over an optimization interval. The goal is to find optimal solutions that are good enough for the majority of time slots. A mechanism for identifying non-dominant solutions is also mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 41: The content is describing a solution algorithm. The algorithm updates an archive by comparing new solutions found with the solutions already saved in previous iterations. If a new solution is dominated by an existing solution, it is not added to the archive. If it dominates one or more existing solutions, the dominated solutions are removed and the new solution is added to the archive. If neither the new solution nor existing solutions dominate each other, the new solution is added to the archive. If the archive is full, solutions that need to be replaced are randomly selected from a subset of solutions with low crowding distance values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 42: The content describes a method for estimating the density of solutions in a neighborhood based on a crowding distance value. The inputs include an archive of non-dominant solutions and the number of solutions in the archive. The outputs include a map of distances for all solutions in the archive. The algorithm calculates the crowding distance value for each solution in the archive based on objective function values. The crowding distance value indicates the density of solutions in the vicinity of that solution. A high crowding distance value suggests fewer solutions nearby, while a low crowding distance value suggests many solutions nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Chunk 43: The content discusses the selection of solutions based on their objective values, with the smallest and largest values being assigned infinite crowding distances. The distance for selecting the intermediary solution is determined by an algorithm. The roulette wheel method is used to select the prey position from less populated areas of the archive. Solutions with higher crowding distance values are more likely to be selected as prey, increasing the diversity of the population and avoiding premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. The content also mentions the multi-criteria HHO solution for optimal scheduling of charging and discharging EVs at the grid, presented in algorithm 2. It starts by generating the initial population of candidate solutions and their initial positions.\n",

      "The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into radiology presents opportunities for improved clinical care and efficiency. However, it also requires a careful approach to minimize potential risks. The focus should be on ensuring models meet the highest standards of safety, effectiveness, and efficacy. This includes rigorous pre-deployment evaluation and validation, implementation of input and output guardrails during production usage, and continuous post-deployment monitoring. AI models must adhere to the same safety, effectiveness, and efficacy standards as other established medical technologies. Trust in AI is earned by demonstrating adherence to these standards and instilling confidence among providers and patients. Collaborative efforts between healthcare systems, industry, academia, and government are essential to address the challenges involved. The safe and ethical deployment of AI systems in radiology requires comprehensive efforts throughout the entire AI product lifecycle. This includes pre-deployment due diligence, quality assurance testing, independent validation studies, live deployment monitoring, and post-deployment surveillance. An end-to-end approach to trustworthy AI deployment emphasizes safeguards across the AI lifecycle, including regulatory, clinical, technical, and ethical considerations. This approach fosters provider confidence in applying AI technologies to improve patient outcomes and quality of care.\n",

      "The article discusses the pre-deployment phase of a radiology AI safety lifecycle approach. It highlights the importance of regulatory due diligence, ensuring AI models meet relevant regulations and standards such as FDA or EU's MDR guidelines for medical devices, including AI-based systems. It emphasizes the need for thorough due diligence by healthcare systems, hospitals, and AI marketplaces deploying these solutions to ensure safety, effectiveness, and regulatory compliance. The regulatory approval process varies in complexity between countries, but all aim to validate the device development methodology, algorithmic safety, and efficacy. AI deployment platforms also need to ensure models listed on them meet all regulatory requirements, including necessary certifications and clearances, compliance with registration obligations, and availability of comprehensive user-facing materials in relevant languages. The article also discusses the need for independent model validation and external retrospective data analysis or randomised controlled trials to verify model performance, calibration, value, and risk. A comprehensive validation is essential given the limited scale and diversity of clinical validation of AI models. The article also emphasizes the importance of model quality control, ensuring AI models perform well at every hospital they are deployed. This includes validating and documenting the model's accuracy and reliability using real-world datasets specific to each hospital and population. Quality control checks can be algorithmic or based on human experts, targeting model inputs, outputs, and population level statistics.\n",

      "The software technology stack used to develop radiology AI models must meet high quality standards for safety and efficacy. When AI medical device manufacturers package these models, they need to ensure their software is free from errors, bugs, and security vulnerabilities. Quality assurance (QA) processes are implemented by the manufacturer, but models need continuous testing at every site they're deployed. Common issues that may occur during installation and deployment include unexpected algorithmic failures, incorrect inputs, and slow performance. To identify these, rigorous software QA testing is required before deployment and after integrating the software with the hospital's IT systems. Input data quality is crucial for ensuring AI models' safety and accuracy. Most models depend on system-level control to ensure data quality. Real-time quality control mechanisms should be in place to ensure that input data distribution doesn't drift from the one used during pre-deployment AI quality control. Output guardrails are also necessary to minimize AI risks at the patient level. Some AI manufacturers implement additional output guardrail mechanisms in the form of model confidence or uncertainty estimation, explicitly explainable models, or separate redundant quality control systems. However, a platform-level redundancy mechanism may be necessary to ensure safety across all deployed AI models. Both input and output data have to be closely monitored to ensure safe and accurate AI model performance. This includes checking data types, validating metadata, confirming protocol parameters, and assessing quality, among other measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The content discusses the importance of various safety mechanisms in AI medical devices. Operating thresholds should be defined based on model specifics and risk tolerance, with alerts triggered for any detected issues. Any low-quality algorithmic output should be deferred to a clinician and integrated with the patient's health record. This deferral mechanism should integrate seamlessly with clinical reporting systems and provide auditable logging of all deferrals. Model execution should be monitored to track key performance indicators such as runtime, failure and deferral rates, accuracy, precision, and recall. Specific metrics like model versioning, runtimes, hardware utilization, errors, audit logs, deferral rates, and accuracy metrics should be tracked for insight into model performance and to enable root cause analysis of problems. Finally, in the post-market surveillance phase, performance drift should be monitored to identify failures and problems that may only be visible at the population level. Changes in data acquisition, updated imaging scanners, and phenotype/population drift effects can cause algorithmic performance decay. If performance degradation is observed, a full clinical review and subsequent quality control study are necessary to prevent further impact on patient care.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI model performance can drift post-deployment due to factors like data drift, phenotype drift, and concept drift. Monitoring metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity over time can detect performance degradation. If drift is suspected, a retrospective analysis should be undertaken, and the model might need retraining, adjustment of operating thresholds, or retirement. Model recalibration is also necessary as data and models drift, requiring adjustment of the operating point of a receiver-operating curve. Monitoring algorithmic sensitivity and specificity over time is crucial to ensure AI models behave appropriately. Bias and fairness are also significant, and model performance should be equitable across different population subgroups. If underperformance is found in certain population segments, a full clinical review should be conducted, followed by appropriate algorithmic remediation. An incident tracking system should be established to proactively collect and review data from devices placed on the market. This is vital for managing risks and ensuring the AI technology remains safe post-deployment. The value of AI models is also significant for building trust in the technology. Evaluating the impact of AI on metrics like clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, operational efficiency, and costs is crucial. A holistic approach to trustworthy AI is needed, including rigorous pre-deployment evaluation, input and output guardrails, and continuous monitoring after deployment. Collaboration between stakeholders across healthcare systems, industry, academia, and government is vital to address the interdisciplinary challenges involved.\n",
